### How to use:

Once opened, user could choose between register and login. 

After logging in, the current username will be displayed on top of the page. The user could type another user's name into the text box at the center of the page and click "add friend" to add the target user as a friend. 

A list of friends is displayed at the bottom of the page. The user could tap on one of the friends and start chatting with him/her. Click "image" button and tap on an image to send a sticker. Type in the text box and click "send" to send a text message.
